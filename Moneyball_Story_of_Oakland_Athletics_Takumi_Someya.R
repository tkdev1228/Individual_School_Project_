### 2. Combine data sets and add three more statistics that were used in Moneyball
#Batting average (BA) is defined by the number of hits divided by at bats, AVG=H/AB. Check Note #1

#On-base percentage (OBP) measures how frequently a batter reaches base, OBP=(H+BB+HBP)/(AB+BB+HBP+SF). Check Note #2
#H = Hits
#BB = Bases on Balls (Walks)
#HBP = Hit By Pitch
#AB = At bat
#SF = Sacrifice fly

#OBP is added to slugging average (SLG) to determine on-base plus slugging (OPS), OPS=OBP+SLG

#Slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter, SLG=(1*B+2*2B+3*3B+4*HR)/AB. Check Note #3


# Calculate batting average (AVG)
merged_data$AVG <- merged_data$H / merged_data$AB

# Calculate on-base percentage (OBP)
merged_data$OBP <- (merged_data$H + merged_data$BB + merged_data$HBP) / 
  (merged_data$AB + merged_data$BB + merged_data$HBP + merged_data$SF)

# Calculate slugging percentage (SLG)
#Singles (X1B) missing from the data, we will calculate it based on the total hits minus rest of hits
merged_data$X1B <- merged_data$H - merged_data$X2B - merged_data$X3B - merged_data$HR
merged_data$SLG <- (1 * merged_data$X1B  + 2 * merged_data$X2B + 3 * merged_data$X3B + 4 * merged_data$HR) / merged_data$AB

# Calculate on-base plus slugging (OPS)
merged_data$OPS <- merged_data$OBP + merged_data$SLG

# Display the first few rows of the updated dataset
head(merged_data,100)

# Replace AVG, OBP, SLG, and OPS with 0 if 0/0 = NA at the time of calculation.
merged_data$AVG[is.na(merged_data$AVG)] <- 0
merged_data$OBP[is.na(merged_data$OBP)] <- 0

# Filtering and refining the data set based on specific criteria.

# [Assumptions]
# Setting team's (Oakland Athletics) strategy as assumptions
# Oakland Athletics adopted the following as their team strategy at the time.
# By deploying a tactic of increasing the number of balls against opposing pitchers and fatiguing them, 
# and by using players with a high on-base percentage, the team aimed to induce mistakes by the opponent and create an offensive advantage. 
# And OBP and other metrics were introduced to evaluate player performance to analyze this quantitatively.
# Since we sign players for several years, we evaluate the stability of those indicators in YEARS and hire players with small variations in them.
# Our team has a small budget and we cannot pay our replacements more salary than we were paying the players being replaced.
# Therefore, we utilize the above indicators and conditions to narrow down the list of potential replacements to three players.

# a)Set thresholds for each indicator based on your team's (Oakland Athletics) strategy
#   Then prioritize and value among the following thresholds in accordance with that strategy. 

# Fine-tune the parameters here
threshold_AVG <- 0.3 #AVG higher than .300 is considered to be excellent (Wikipedia, 2023)
threshold_OBP <- 0.360 #Batting average higher than .36 is considered to be above average (Rogers, 2023)
threshold_SLG <- 0.450 #A good slugging percentage in baseball is 0.450 (Rogers, 2023)
threshold_OPS <- 0.800
year <- 2002 #available players after the departure of Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, and Jason Isringhausen

# Extract rows where AVG, OBP, SLG, and OPS are all above the threshold
filtered_players <- merged_data[merged_data$AVG >= threshold_AVG & 
                                  merged_data$OBP >= threshold_OBP & 
                                  merged_data$SLG >= threshold_SLG & 
                                  merged_data$OPS >= threshold_OPS &
                                  merged_data$yearID <= year, ]

### 5. Conclusion

# [Insights & Comments]
# By replacing injured players on the Oakland Athletics team with Glenallen Hill(hillgl01), 
# Wade Boggs(boggswa01), and Kal Daniels(danieka01) based on their statistical comparisons, 
# the team can potentially save a significant portion of their salary while 
# increasing their chances of winning. These players' performance indicators 
# suggest that they can achieve comparable outcomes at a much lower cost, 
# providing a tactical advantage in terms of optimizing resources and competitiveness.

# [Our Decision-Making Approach & Implementation]
# We set out to figure out the team's situation and fundamental strategy, which we then put into a quantitative indicator. 
# First, we evaluated AVG, OBP, SLG, and OPS as indicators of a player's ability in order to find them among a large number of potential players. 
# In addition, we used the year-to-year deviations of the above indicators to filter the candidates in order to select players who are expected to be stable and successful. 
# We then systematically identified them by searching for the optimal combination of a larger OPS, which was of particular importance, 
# and the sum of the salaries of the three alternative players, which fell within the budget.

# Notes:
# 1. "Batting average (AVG) is determined by dividing a player's hits by his total at-bats" (MLB, 2024)
# AVG = Hits / At Bats = H/AB
# 2."On Base Percentage (OBP) refers to how frequently a batter reaches base per plate appearance. 
# Times on base include hits, walks and hit-by-pitches, but do not include errors, 
# times reached on a fielder's choice or a dropped third strike." (MLB, 2024)
# OBP = Hits + BaseonBalls + HitByPitch  / At Bats + BaseonBalls + HitByPitch + Sacrifice Flies
# OBP = H + BB + HBP/AB + BB + HBP + SF
# 3."Slugging percentage (SLG) represents the total number of bases a player records per at-bat." (MLB, 2024)
# SLG = (X1B + 2*X2B + 3*X3B + 4*HR)/AB
#Singles (X1B) missing from the data, we will calculate it based on the total hits minus rest of hits
# 4. "On-base Plus Slugging (OPS) adds on-base percentage and slugging percentage to get one number that 
# unites the two. It's meant to combine how well a hitter can reach base, with how well he can hit for 
# average and for power." (MLB, 2024)
# On-base percentage + Slugging percentage = OBP + SLG
